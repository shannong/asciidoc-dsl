# asciidoc-dsl
Asciidoc is a powerful rendering engine for producing beautiful HTML, PDF, and EPUB3 output.  However, building Asciidoc syntax in Java can be cumbersome.  Asciidoc-DSL seeks to overcome this problem by allowing users to generate natural object graphs representing the document structure they wish to produce.  Asciidoc-DSL then renders the document in a format that can be used as an input to AascidoctorJ to produce the desired output.
